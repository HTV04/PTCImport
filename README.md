Current version: v1.0

Begone, QR codes!

PTCImport is a GodMode9 script that imports PTC files directly into Petit Computer.

## Usage
* Make sure the latest version of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9) is installed.
* Extract PTCImport.zip to the root of your SD card.
* Put any PTC files you want to import into the PTC folder in the PTCImport folder.
* Open GodMode9, and when on the root menu (with the list of mounted drives), press the HOME button.
* Choose "Scripts..."
* Choose "PTCImport."
* Follow the on-screen prompts.
* When the script is finished, relock permissions and reboot.
* Open Petit Computer.
* Your imported files should be present!

## To-Do
* Use internal filename from the PTC file, rather than use the filename of the PTC file, which if incompatible with Petit Computer can cause problems.
* Add menu for choosing multiple options.
* Add option to choose a PTC file from the Petit Computer's SD export folder.
* Add option to mount the save file for quick access (with warning, because PTC files can't be directly imported by copying them to the save file).
* Add option to restore the save file from the backup (with warning, because this is irreversible).
